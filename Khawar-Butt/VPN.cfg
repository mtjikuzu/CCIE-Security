VPNs

- Connecting 2 Private networks over a public network. 
- This could be done by using a L2, MPLS or L3 technology
- L2 VPN [VPLS, Frame Relay, Q-in-Q Tunneling, MMPLS AToM etc]
- L3 VPN [IPSec, GRE, SSL]

IPSec LAN-To-LAN VPN

- Connects 2 sites together in a secure manner. 
- The 2 sites will use a key to encrypt the data. It will be the same key on both sides. 
- If you use the same key for a long time, the man in the middle will be able to collect a lot of data and run it against the Brute force dictionary attack. By running a lot of data thru
the Brute force attack, they will be able to crack the key. 
- To counter this issue, change the key on a regular basis so that the attacker will not be able to collect a lot of data. 
- A special mechanism was developed to generate this Data Encryption key dynamically. This mechanism was called Diffie Hellman
- Both devices would generate their own Ecryption Key. This key needed to be exchanged with the peer so that they would know how to decrypt. 
- To exchange this Dynamic [session key] in a secure manner, a protocol was used to setup a Secure Tunnel. This protocol was called ISAKMP/IKE
- To encrypt any tunnel, you need 3 components:
 -- Key
 -- Encryption mechanism
 -- Hash
- We set these parameters manually on both devices. They need to match for the tunnel to come up. We will set the key manually over here although you do have the ability to use a mechanism called PKI to generate dynamic keys for ISAKMP as well. 
- Once this is done, my first tunnel is up. DH generates and exchanges the session key with the peer. 
- The end result of the Phase I [IKE/ISAKMP] is that the session keys are exchanged in a secure manner. 

- Now we need to seup the Data Tunnel [Phase II]. This is done by a protocol known as ESP, You also have the 3 parameters required for setting up a secure tunnel [Key, Encryption & Hash]. As we already have the key, the only parameters that need to be set are 
the encryption and the hash.
- These parameters need to match the Phase II parameters of the peer. They do not need to match Phase I parameters.
