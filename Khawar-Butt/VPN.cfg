VPNs

- Connecting 2 Private networks over a public network. 
- This could be done by using a L2, MPLS or L3 technology
- L2 VPN [VPLS, Frame Relay, Q-in-Q Tunneling, MMPLS AToM etc]
- L3 VPN [IPSec, GRE, SSL]

IPSec LAN-To-LAN VPN

- Connects 2 sites together in a secure manner. 
- The 2 sites will use a key to encrypt the data. It will be the same key on both sides. 
- If you use the same key for a long time, the man in the middle will be able to collect a lot of data and run it against the Brute force dictionary attack. By running a lot of data thru
the Brute force attack, they will be able to crack the key. 
- To counter this issue, change the key on a regular basis so that the attacker will not be able to collect a lot of data.
